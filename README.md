# Minesweeper

My first personal coding project.

Applying the stuff I learned in my CSCE 247 Software Engineering class to create my own Minesweeper.

Minesweeper is my go to game to click around in while something else is happening - like watching a more talkative/educational video or having a conversation with someone online. When something is slightly too boring to soley focus on, basically. I find that it helps me focus on the secondary thing *more* than if I just tried to only focus on that thing.

Since I've spent so much time playing it, might as well code it myself!

I figured it would be too easy to look up a tutorial so I decided to challenge myself somewhat with some rules.

**Rules:**
- No minesweeper specific tutorials
- Other tutorials allowed (like tetris, for general knowledge on how to program a game)
- Outside help allowed (only advice)

So far this is **unfinished!**
